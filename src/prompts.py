GRADE_PROMPT = """You are a grader assessing relevance of retrieved documents to a user question.

Retrieved documents: 
{context}

User question: {question}

Evaluation criteria:
- If documents contain DIRECTLY relevant information: score 'yes'
- If documents contain PARTIALLY relevant or background information: score 'yes'  
- If the question is a simple greeting, personal question, or general conversation that doesn't require specific document information: score 'yes' (to avoid unnecessary rewriting)
- Only score 'no' if documents are completely irrelevant AND the question clearly requires specific factual information

Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no'."""

SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """You are super smart chatbot named WDM-AI-TEMIS, an AI assistant with access to a knowledge base through the retriever_tool.

For EVERY user question, you should:
1. ALWAYS use the retriever_tool first to search the knowledge base
2. After getting search results, provide a comprehensive answer combining:
   - Information from the retrieved documents 
   - Your own knowledge when relevant
3. If no relevant information is found in the search results, you can fall back to your general knowledge
4. Be direct and helpful in your responses

IMPORTANT: Always search first, then answer. This ensures you provide the most up-to-date and relevant information from the knowledge base.

The vector store contains data from the following sources:

REWRITE_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant helping to improve search queries.
Original query: {query}

Rewrite this query to:
1. Be more specific and detailed
2. Include key terms that might appear in relevant documents
3. Focus on the core information need

Provide:
1. The rewritten query
2. A brief explanation of how you improved it"""

GENERATE_PROMPT = """You are a helpful assistant answering the user's most recent question based on the provided context.

Context information is provided in XML format with multiple documents:
{context}

FOCUS ON ANSWERING THIS SPECIFIC QUESTION: {question}

Instructions:
- The context is structured as XML with <documents> containing multiple <document> elements
- Each document has <metadata> (with source, page, type) and <content> sections
- If the context contains relevant information: provide a COMPLETE answer using ALL relevant information from ALL documents
- If the context contains tables or lists, include ALL items, don't summarize or truncate
- When referencing information, you can mention the source document and page number from metadata
- Format your response clearly with bullet points or numbered lists when appropriate
- If the question is a simple greeting, personal question, or general conversation, you can answer directly using your knowledge
- If the context doesn't contain relevant information for factual questions, say so clearly and provide what you can from your general knowledge
- Be natural and conversational while being informative and comprehensive
- Focus on answering the user's question rather than describing the document structure"""


QUERY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert document analyst. Your task is to analyze the user query and determine which document sources and types are most relevant.

Guidelines:
- Only suggest sources and types that actually exist in the document collection
- Be specific and relevant to the query content
- Provide reasoning for your choices
- If uncertain, indicate lower confidence score
- DO NOT return any page numbers - focus only on sources and types
- For sources, you can suggest partial filenames (without extensions) if the user refers to them that way

User Query: {query}

Important: Return only valid JSON format as specified above. Do not include pages in your response.

GRAPH_SYSTEM_LLM_PARSER = """Your task is to act as an expert information extractor. From the provided INPUT_TEXT, you will extract a knowledge graph.

The output must be a JSON object with a single key "graph", which contains a list of structured objects. Each object represents a relationship triplet and must have the following keys: 'h', 'type_h', 'r', 'o', 'type_t'.

GUIDELINES:
1. 'h' (head) and 'o' (tail) are the entities.
2. 'type_h' and 'type_t' are the general categories. You must infer these types. Types should be concise, capitalized, singular nouns (e.g., PERSON, COMPANY, VEHICLE, LOCATION, PRODUCT).
3. **Crucially, identify abstract concepts like EVENTS (e.g., 'Battle of New York', 'Ultron's Attack') and PROTOCOLS (e.g., 'Sokovia Accords').**
4. 'r' (relationship) is a short, active verb.
  - For actions between entities, use verbs like: Drove, Invented, Created, Wields, Led, Defeated.
  - **For cause-and-effect, use verbs like: Caused, LedTo, ResultedIn.**
  - **For participation, use: ParticipatedIn.**
5. **Entity Disambiguation**: Consolidate different names for the same entity.
6. **Simplicity**: Keep entity names short and specific.

EXAMPLE 1 (Business):
- Input: 'The 2008 financial crisis led to the creation of the Dodd-Frank Act.'
- Output:
{{
  "graph": [
    {{ "h": "2008 Financial Crisis", "type_h": "EVENT", "r": "LedTo", "o": "Dodd-Frank Act", "type_t": "PROTOCOL" }}
  ]
}}

EXAMPLE 2 (MCU - a more relevant example for you):
- Input: 'The Battle of New York was a major conflict where the Avengers first assembled to fight Loki.'
- Output:
{{
  "graph": [
      {{ "h": "Avengers", "type_h": "GROUP", "r": "ParticipatedIn", "o": "Battle of New York", "type_t": "EVENT" }},
      {{ "h": "Loki", "type_h": "PERSON", "r": "ParticipatedIn", "o": "Battle of New York", "type_t": "EVENT" }}
  ]
}}

Your output MUST be a valid JSON object. Do not add any text before or after the JSON.
