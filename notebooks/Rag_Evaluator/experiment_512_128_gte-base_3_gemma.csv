However, based on the data available for 2017-2019, we can determine which of those seasons had the highest average attendance. To do this, we would need to calculate the average attendance for each year. The document includes three columns of attendance data for each year.

To determine the season with the highest average attendance between 2017-2019, I will calculate the average of the three attendance figures for each year and then compare those averages.

**Calculations:**

*   **2017:** (13,913 + 24,929 + 11,219) / 3 = 16,687
*   **2018:** (14,211 + 18,104 + 10,844) / 3 = 14,386.33
*   **2019:** (12,789 + 16,734 + 9,819) / 3 = 13,114

**Conclusion:**

Based on these calculations, **2017** had the highest average attendance between 2017 and 2019.",2016,,,,0.0
