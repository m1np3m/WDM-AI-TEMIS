## Main [ edit ]

## Malcolm [ edit ]

Malcolm, played by actor Frankie Muniz (in a total of 150 episodes), is the main protagonist and occasional narrator of this series. He is approximately five years younger than his oldest brother Francis, one year younger than his older brother Reese, five years older than their younger brother Dewey, and about 15 years older than their youngest brother Jamie. In the first episode of the series, he is discovered to be a child prodigy and was immediately moved from his regular class into the "Krelboynes", a class for gifted students. Despite his high intelligence, he still gets into mischief either alongside or working against his brothers (in particular, his older brother Reese), although he becomes more self-centered and vain in the later seasons as he goes through puberty. Being a genius, Malcolm often serves as the ring leader in the brothers' juvenile schemes. According to Hal, in "Stock Car Races" (season 1), Malcolm was named after Hal's favorite Stock Car Racer, Rusty Malcolm, although he had previously argued with Lois about giving the name to Francis and Reese. Malcolm, like Reese, is very unpopular at school, yet he has had a number of girlfriends during the series run. Like Lois, he gets angry or frustrated very easily but he also has problems containing his opinion about himself. Malcolm also occasionally serves as the voice of reason, and does have a conscience. For instance, despite emotionally manipulating a grieving Hal to buy him a car in the episode "Hal Grieves," when the time comes to make the purchase, he feels guilty (but just as Hal begins to sign, Lois finally turns up and she, not Malcom, puts an end to it). In the series finale, it is revealed that Lois intended him to have a hard life, knowing that he is destined to assume the role of President of the United States. Lois wants him to remember where he came from to get there and help families like his own when he assumes the office. Malcolm eventually comes to terms with his future, after being unable to tell her that he can not do it. In the series finale, he begins taking classes at Harvard University. Throughout the series, Malcolm frequently breaks the fourth wall and talks to the viewer about either the current situation or provides exposition about past events.[2]

## Lois [ edit ]

Lois, played by Jane Kaczmarek (146 episodes), is Francis, Reese, Malcolm, Dewey, and Jamie's temperamental and overbearing mother. She is despised by the neighbors to the point that they refuse to invite her to their gatherings, revealed in "Mono". Unlike Malcolm, Lois is not bothered by it and tries her best to blend in with it. Lois is 38 years old as of Season 2, and had originally planned to attend music school and become a concert violinist before she married Hal ("Lois' Birthday"). She was revealed to be a charming and nurturing mother while Francis was little, but toughened up. When she became more overbearing and demanding, it did not help Francis or the other boys to behave, but she unknowingly made it worse. She also stubbornly believes she is always in the right, to the point of being unable to say that she was wrong. Lois's severe anger issues are very often caused by her sons' frequent bad behavior, and also from her miserable childhood. Her uncaring parents Ida and Victor favored her younger sister, Susan. Lois and Susan would later have a serious falling out after it is revealed that Hal was originally Susan's boyfriend. She is a pushy academic mother and in the series finale, it is revealed that she is trying to groom Malcolm to become President of the United States. The finale also reveals that she is pregnant again. Lois is usually seen driving the family's early 1990s Plymouth Grand Voyager.[2]

## Hal [ edit ]

Hal, played by Bryan Cranston (151 episodes), is the father of the family. Though relaxed in his parenting when compared to Lois, Hal has shown that he can slide into a disciplinarian when confronted by the boys' bad behavior. He was a rebel like his sons, especially Francis, until he married Lois and she nurtured him. He comes from a wealthy family who resent his choice to marry Lois
