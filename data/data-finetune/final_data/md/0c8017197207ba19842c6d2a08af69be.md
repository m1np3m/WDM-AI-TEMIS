Special Father #1: Giuseppe Cantalupi (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) is the apparent leader of the trio. He is heard giving a monologue at the beginning of almost every episode.

Special Father #2: Benetti (voiced by Sam Seder) is the most quiet of the trio. He speaks with an Italian accent and is never seen without his night-vision goggles.

Special Sister: Mary (voiced by Eugene Mirman) - With a lazy eye and a shrill, grating voice, Sister Mary seems to be the most dedicated to the Special Clergy's mission. She is not above killing innocent bystanders, and will do so at the slightest provocation.

Ethan (voiced by Todd Barry) is Lucy's date in episode one "He's Not the Messiah, He's a DJ".

# Episodes [ edit ]

The pilot first aired in 2005, and the series began in 2007. A unique feature of Lucy is that each episode features a different opening sequence with a new theme song.
