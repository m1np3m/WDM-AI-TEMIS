The group have been compared to One Direction and labelled a boy band since their first fame in late 2012,[7] a label which continued to be applied in 2014.[57][58] The band disagree with the stereotyping, pointing to the fact that they formed by themselves—they are not the product of a record producer—and they play their own instruments.[59][60] They have been inspired by McFly, Blink-182, Ed Sheeran, Mumford& Sons,[1] Taylor Swift,[61] and Justin Bieber.[62]
