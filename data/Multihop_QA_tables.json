As a result, the club went from being debt-free to\nbeing saddled with debts of £540 million, at interest rates of between 7% and 20%.[15][213][214]\nIn July 2006, the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30 per cent\nreduction in annual interest payments to £62 million a year.[215][216] In January 2010, with debts of\n£716.5 million ($1.17 billion),[217] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth\n£504 million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509 million owed to international banks.[218] The annual\ninterest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45 million per\nannum.[219] Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old\nTrafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre.[220][221] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to\nwear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester\nUnited Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \"Red Knights\", with\nplans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.[222] The club's debts reached a high of £777 million in\nJune 2007.[223]\nIn August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1 billion\n(approx. £600 million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club",

A new electoral\nlaw was enacted in late 2011 but was declared\nunconstitutional once again by the Federal Constitutional\nCourt upon lawsuits from the opposition parties and a group of\nsome 4,000 private citizens.[5]\nFour of the five factions in the Bundestag agreed on an\nelectoral reform whereby the number of seats in the\nBundestag will be increased as much as necessary to ensure\nthat any overhang seats are compensated through\napportioned leveling seats, to ensure full proportionality\naccording to the political party's share of party votes at the\nnational level.[6] The Bundestag approved and enacted the\nnew electoral reform in February 2013.[7]",

The\nbig loser of the election was the SPD, which received its worst result ever in a\nfederal election, receiving only 23% of the total party vote and suffering the\nbiggest percentage loss of any party in German federal election history in 60\nyears. The two other parties represented in the Bundestag, the Left and the\nGreens, both made large gains and received the highest vote share of their\nrespective histories. For the first time, The Left won constituency seats outside\nits traditional stronghold of East Berlin. As a result of the losses by the SPD\nand the gains by the FDP, the alliance of the CDU/CSU and FDP received an\noutright majority of seats, ensuring that Angela Merkel would continue as\nchancellor.\nHad the CDU/CSU and FDP failed to win a majority of seats, possible\nalternative coalitions may have included a continuation of the grand coalition\nof CDU/CSU and SPD.

The remaining funds came from MLSE, which paid $10 million for the naming\nrights of the stadium for the duration of the 20-year management agreement, which they later resold to the\nBank of Montreal (BMO) for $27 million over the first 10 years.[27][29][30]\nThe proposal approved by the City of Toronto was for a stadium that was \"capable of a conversion to a\nfootball format.\"[14][31] The Argonauts attempted to join the project at the last minute, but MLSE, citing\nbudget and time limitations, constructed the stadium such that it could not fit a CFL field without demolition\nand reconstruction of the end zone stands.[31][32][33]"

      "Friedkin with wife Sherry\nLansing in 2012happened upon the scene and captured what was going on as you do in a documentary. My first\nfilms were documentaries too.

It lasted two years,\nduring which the couple announced their engagement, but the relationship\nended about 1972.[51] Friedkin began a four-year relationship with\nAustralian dancer and choreographer Jennifer Nairn-Smith in 1972. Although they announced an\nengagement twice, they never married.

She starred in the Kennedy Center Honors for Ginger\nRogers, and in Disney's Premiere in Central Park with Pocahontas, The Walt Disney World 25th Anniversary\nSpectacular and Disney's 100 Years of Magic. Benson is the resident guest soloist for the Walt Disney\nCompany/Disney Cruise Line and ambassador for feature animation.\nOn June 6, 2016, Benson performed the role of Ariel at the Hollywood Bowl's concert performance of The\nLittle Mermaid.[16] She also made a special appearance in ABC's 2019 live musical spectacular The Little\nMermaid Live![17] Benson was originally going to reprise her role as Sam in the 2022 film Disenchanted, but\nher scene was cut from the movie.[18] She recently lent her voice to Ariel in the 2022 video game Disney\nDreamlight Valley as well as singing as Ariel on various Disney Princess albums of the 2000s. From 1992 to\n2011 she was the official voice of Barbie for Mattel and Pixar for projects such as Toy Story and Dance!\nWorkout with Barbie, until the role was taken over by Kate Higgins starting with the series Life in the\nDreamhouse.\nIn June 2023, Benson starred as Mama Rose in a concert production of Gypsy alongside her daughter\nDelany at the Barbara B.

The two had just worked together in the Broadway show Smile until its run ended early. He knew\nshe would be the perfect fit for the role and that she would be a great replica of Ariel.[24][25] After hearing the\ndemo for \"Part of Your World\", she sang a small part of it on tape where it was later sent to Disney\nexecutives. Before her audition for The Little Mermaid, she was primarily a stage actress. It was Ashman's\nfirst Disney project. In early 1988, Benson won the role of Ariel and has been voicing her ever since.[24][26]"

It featured collaborations with\nsongwriter Kim Kun-woo, vocal trainer Mellow, soprano Han Kyung-mi, and singers Huh Gak and Bobby\nKim. Bobby Kim complimented So's rapping in their duet track That Day, a Year Ago, saying, \"So has a\ntalent in feeling the groove and it's as good as his acting skills.\"[74][75] So also starred in a music video of the\nalbum's title song \"Some Kind of Story\".[76]\nIn January 2013, So released another rap EP titled 6 PM...Ground, and his recording process aired on\nMusic Triangle as part of Mnet's Collabo One project.[77][78] The four songs of the album were combined to\nmake a 12-minute music drama starring So, Park Shin-hye and Yoo Seung-ho; which was also re-edited into\nindividual music videos for each track.[79][80]\nIn June 2014, So released his third electro-hip-hop EP titled 18 Years, which represents how long he has\nbeen in the industry since he debuted as an actor.

He was the first Korean actor to have an entire road named after him.[84][85]\nHe was also named promotional ambassadors for cyber crime prevention by the National Police Agency,\nhelping to raise awareness and prevent cyber crimes such as hacking and Internet fraud by taking part in\nvarious promotional activities.[86]\nInvestments [edit]\nSo is the owner of the Apgujeong-dong branch of CJ Foodville's A Twosome Place.[87][88]\nHe has also helped imported foreign films, having invested in art-house films such as the U.S.-British-French\nco-production Philomena (2014), the Chinese film Coming Home (2014), the Japanese crime thriller The\nWorld of Kanako (2014), and the American horror film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2015).[89]\nPersonal life [edit]\nIn 2019, So confirmed that he was in a relationship with former announcer and reporter Jo Eun-jung.[90] On\nApril 7, 2020, the actor's label 51K confirmed that he had registered his marriage with Jo.[91]"

      "qualification events, mostly held in the U.S. but also in Europe and Japan. The U.S. Open has no barrier to\nentry for either women or junior players, as long as they are a professional or meet amateur handicap\nrequirements. As of 2024, however, no female golfer has yet qualified for the U.S. Open, although in 2006\nMichelle Wie made it to the second qualifying stage. Finally, the U.S. Open has the strictest 36-hole cut of\nany major championship (by percentage of the field), with only the top 60 players and ties of the 156-player\nfield playing the final two days.[16]\nWhile the U.S. Open employed an 18-hole playoff for many years if players were tied after four rounds, the\nUSGA announced that beginning in 2018 all of its future championships would implement a two-hole\naggregate playoff format. A sudden-death playoff would follow if the players were still tied after the two\nplayoff holes.[18] This change also brought the U.S. Open more in line with both the Open and PGA\nChampionships, which use four- and three-hole aggregate playoffs respectively, followed by sudden death if\nnecessary, and most regular events as well as the Masters only have simple sudden-death playoffs. The\nSunday of the Championship has also in recent years fallen on Father's Day (at least as recognized in the\nUS and the UK) which has lent added poignancy to winners' speeches.\nThe Open Championship [edit]\nThe year's final major, The Open Championship (sometimes referred to as the British Open), is organized by\nThe R&A, an offshoot of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, and is typically played on a links-\nstyle course in the United Kingdom (primarily Scotland or England) according to the tournament's official\ncourse rotation. First contested in 1860, it carries the prestige of being the oldest professional golf\ntournament currently in existence and the original \"Open\" championship (although the very first event was\nheld only for British professionals). It is respected for maintaining the tradition of links play that dates back to\nthe very invention of the game in Scotland. Links courses are generally typified as coastal, flat and often\nvery windswept, with the fairways cut through dune grass and gorse bushes that make up the \"rough\", and\nhave deep bunkers. The course is generally not \"doctored\" to make it more difficult, effectively making the\nvariable weather the main external influence on the field's score.[19] Also, the greens at Open venues tend to\nbe set up to play more slowly than those of normal tour stops. In windy conditions, a course with fast greens\ncan become unplayable because the wind could affect balls at rest; the third round of the 2015 Open saw\nmany delays for this very reason.[20]\nAs well as exempting from qualifying recent professional major and amateur champions, all former Open\nChampionship winners under age 60 (with the age cutoff being reduced to 55 for those winning their first\nOpen in 2024 or later), and leading players from the world rankings, the R&A ensures that leading golfers\nfrom around the globe are given the chance to enter by holding qualifying events on all continents, as well\nas holding final qualifying events around the UK in the weeks before the main tournament.\nThe champion receives (and has his name inscribed on the base of) the famous Claret Jug, a trophy that\ndates back to 1872 (champions from 1860 until 1871 received instead a championship belt, much like a\nchampion professional boxer's belt nowadays) and the engraving of the champions' name on the trophy"
