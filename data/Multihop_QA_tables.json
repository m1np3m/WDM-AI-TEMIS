They were designed by Peter B. Moore, and released during Jordan's sophomore season with the Chicago Bulls. The Jordan 1 Royal was never worn by Michael Jordan on an NBA court. The black and red Air Jordan 1 has been re-released several times, starting in [20][21] 1994. The red and black colorway of the Nike Air Ship, the prototype for the Jordan I, was later outlawed by then-NBA Commissioner David Stern for having very little white on them. (This rule, known as the \"51 percent\" rule, was [22][23] repealed in the late 2000s.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Air Jordan II   |   1986 | The success of the Air Jordan I encouraged Nike to release a new Air Jordan in 1986 for the new basketball season. Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the Air Jordan II was originally made in Italy.[24][25] In early tests, Michael Jordan wore a prototype that fused the upper of the original Air Jordan with the cushioning being designed for the new model. The Air Jordan II featured a full-length Air-Sole unit and a polyurethane midsole. The shoe bore a similar silhouette to the Nike Air Python that would release the following year. It featured a faux lizard skin and swooping lines that resembled the detailing of a sports car. This design aesthetic would factor into the Air Jordan line later in the series. The Air Jordan II was the first Jordan not to have the Nike swoosh on the upper, though \"Nike\" was stitched across [25] the heel counter. Michael Jordan wore the Air Jordan II for a shortened 18 games in the 1986–87 season due to a broken foot. It had several re-releases as the Jordan 2 Retro. |"
